# Welcome to camphew!

*camphew* is an educational project for teaching computer-controlled lab instrumentation based on single-file script
and using a widely supported python package, matplotlib.

As an example, *camphew* enables live preview of images obtained from a Basler camera, and basic live operations on these
images.

For more advance GUIs (using PyQt5) and interaction with various types of hardware in a systemic way, using config
files and object-oriented operator classes, youu are invited to use the more advanced *labphew* code structure

*labphew* is a minimalist code and folder structure for teaching computer-controlled lab instrumentation in Python.
The main purpose of Labphew is to provide a basis for those with little coding experience to build their own
user-interface(s) for a piece of hardware or to control a measurement and save their date in a properly
reproducible manner.

You can read all the available instructions on [labphew documentation](https://labphew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
